# DrelTools: A dREL to Julia translator

## Introduction

dREL (J. Chem. Inf. Model., 2012, 52 (8), pp 1917â€“1925
DOI: 10.1021/ci300076w) is a machine-readable language for describing the
relationships between data names defined in a CIF (Crystallographic
Information Framework) dictionary.  Examples of dREL
use can be found in 
[the latest CIF core dictionary](https://github.com/COMCIFS/cif_core/cif_core.dic).

This package is experimental.  Method and type names are subject to
change. Suggestions on speed improvement and new functionality
are welcome.

## Installation

Install Julia.  At the Pkg prompt (ie after entering `]`) type
`add DrelTools`.  Simply put `using DrelTools` at the top of any
Julia code that uses methods from this package.

Note that CIF support is provided by the [CrystalInfoFramework](https://github.com/jamesrhester/CrystalInfoFramework.jl) package, which you will probably also need to install in order to read in CIF
files.

Please advise of any difficulties in installation so that either these
instructions or the installation setup can be improved.

## Documentation

Documentation is available [here](https://jamesrhester.github.io/DrelTools.jl/dev/).

## Usage

1. ``define_dict_funcs(c::Cifdic)`` will
process all dREL functions found in the dictionary. This must be
called if the dictionary contains a ``Function`` category that
defines functions used in other dREL fragments.
Note that dREL functions are like library functions
that are not associated with data names, unlike the methods found 
inside definitions.
2. A ``DynamicDDLmRC`` is a container that holds relations (ie tables), whose
contents are described by a DDLm dictionary. It takes any ``DataSource``,
including CIF data blocks. It is dynamic because it can derive missing
values using dREL fragments in the dictionary. The resulting values are **not**
stored in the block, but are cached. The example below shows how a ``DynamicDDLmRC``
is created from a data block and a dictionary.
3. ``derive(d::DynamicDDLmRC,s::String)`` will derive the value of dataname
``s`` based on other values in the block and dREL code found in the dictionary
associated with ``d``.
4. ``empty_cache!(d::dynamic_block)`` clears cached values from previous
derivations.

```julia
    p = DDLm_Dictionary("cif_core.dic")
    define_dict_funcs(p)    #add dREL Functions to dictionary
    n = NativeCif("nick1.cif") #Read in a CIF file
    b = n["saly2_all_aniso"] #select a data block
    t = TypedDataSource(b,p) #p describes the data in b
    db = DynamicDDLmRC(t,p) #create a dynamic block
    # 
    # (Re)evaluate an item
    #
    s = derive(db,"_cell.atomic_mass") #derive value
```

``test/drel_exec.jl`` contains simple demonstrations of how to
make use of dREL scripts found in dictionaries.

## Note

The `deps` directory contains a short script to pre-build the dREL grammar. When
changing the grammar this should be re-run.
